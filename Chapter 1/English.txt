Introduction to the Canonical Books of the Old Testament.

§ 1. Definition and Method.

The Old Testament Canon is the complete, inspired, written presentation of the divine revelation of salvation in the time of the Old Covenant. This revelation of God is essentially a sacred history, governed by God’s Law and Promise, a gracious salvation of a chosen people. The Old Testament Canon therefore becomes the presentation—breathed into and illuminated by the Spirit of God Himself—of the Law, the Promises, and the saving acts, and of the spiritual life in Israel which was awakened, called forth, and sustained by these means.

Now both the Law and the Promises were given at definite times and under definite circumstances, and the whole of sacred history has its periods and epochs. From this it follows of necessity that, just as there is a history of revelation and a history of the people of Israel, so there is also a history of Holy Scripture. Holy Scripture thus comes to consist of many writings, which have arisen under particular conditions and each with its own distinctive content. And although all these writings are driven forth by the same divine Spirit, they are nevertheless a spiritual unity, so that, though they are many, they together constitute one Holy Scripture.

The earlier writings point forward to the later, and the later look back to the earlier; the one writing fills out the other, until they all together form the complete and closed ring which fully and infallibly presents the divine revelation in the time of the Old Testament.

It will, then, be the first task of the Introduction to give a general survey of the coming-into-being of Holy Scripture in the time of the Old Testament; from this it will appear how Scripture, in its origin, follows Revelation, or the holy history, step by step. Thereupon the Introduction must take up the several writings each by itself, and show under what circumstances they have come to be, what their content is, and how each of them forms a necessary link in the whole of Holy Scripture. Thereto is naturally joined an inquiry into how the several writings have been gathered into one Holy Scripture, and how the one Holy Scripture has been preserved unto this present.

The task of the Introduction is therefore best fulfilled by:

* to search out, as exactly as possible, the time of composition and the historical circumstances of each writing;

* to set forth the content and the line of thought of each writing as fully as time allows;

* to demonstrate each writing’s place in the whole organism of the holy writings.
