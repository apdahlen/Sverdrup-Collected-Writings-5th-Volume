STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Kanon” — not merely a list, but the authoritative, inspired corpus; must retain doctrinal weight.
* “Aabenbaring” — revelation as divine self-disclosure, not mere information.
* “Forjættelse” — promise in a redemptive, covenantal sense (cf. KJV “promise”).
* “Frelse / Frelserne” — salvation and saving acts, not abstract deliverance.
* “Aand” — Spirit, specifically the divine Spirit.
* “Indblæste” — inspired (God-breathed), with theological precision.
* “Pagts Tid” — covenantal era, not simply historical period.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with cumulative logic.
* Parallel triads (Law, Promise, Salvation).
* Semicolon-like pivots that must not be flattened.
* Careful cause–effect reasoning linking revelation, history, and Scripture.

Theological Hazards:

* Confusing revelation with history rather than sacred history.
* Weakening inspiration into mere religious reflection.
* Losing covenantal and redemptive framework.
* Diluting unity-in-diversity of Scripture.

Voice Hazards:

* Over-modernization would erase solemn, academic-theological cadence.
* Excessive simplification would blunt confessional clarity.
* Loss of reverent, didactic tone.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “hellig Historie” — sacred history: history governed by God’s redemptive purpose.
* “behersket af Guds Lov og Forjættelse” — ruled or governed, not merely influenced.
* “Ring” — metaphor of a completed circle, indicating organic wholeness.
* Biblical resonance with Romans 15 and Hebrews 1 regarding progressive revelation.
* KJV equivalents favored: Law, Promise, Spirit, Holy Scripture.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Definition of the Old Testament canon.
* Nature of divine revelation as redemptive history.
* Connection between revelation, covenant, and people.
* Necessity of historical development and periods.
* Resulting multiplicity of writings.
* Unity of Scripture through one divine Spirit.
* Organic completion of revelation as a whole.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Inspiration (“God-breathed”) echoes 2 Timothy 3:16.
* Progressive revelation echoes Hebrews 1:1.
* Unity of Scripture echoes Luke 24:27.
* Covenant history reflects Exodus–Deuteronomy framework.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain academic solemnity and theological seriousness.
* Preserve declarative certainty.
* Avoid speculative or tentative phrasing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “følger med Nødvendighed” rendered as “follows of necessity.”
* Avoid weakening causal claims.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kanon — Canon
* Aabenbaring — Revelation
* Lov — Law
* Forjættelse — Promise
* Aand — Spirit
* hellig Skrift — Holy Scripture

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve the image of Scripture as a ring/circle.
* Maintain forward–backward pointing of texts.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Maintain steady didactic tone without emotional flattening.
* Preserve progression from definition to conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where argument demands it.
* Preserve rhythmic parallelism.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Introduction to the Canonical Books of the Old Testament.

§ 1. Definition and Method.

The Old Testament Canon is the complete, inspired, written presentation of the divine revelation of salvation in the time of the Old Covenant. This revelation of God is essentially a sacred history, governed by God’s Law and Promise, a gracious salvation of a chosen people. The Old Testament Canon therefore becomes the presentation—breathed into and illuminated by the Spirit of God Himself—of the Law, the Promises, and the saving acts, and of the spiritual life in Israel which was awakened, called forth, and sustained by these means.

Now both the Law and the Promises were given at definite times and under definite circumstances, and the whole of sacred history has its periods and epochs. From this it follows of necessity that, just as there is a history of revelation and a history of the people of Israel, so there is also a history of Holy Scripture. Holy Scripture thus comes to consist of many writings, which have arisen under particular conditions and each with its own distinctive content. And although all these writings are driven forth by the same divine Spirit, they are nevertheless a spiritual unity, so that, though they are many, they together constitute one Holy Scripture.

The earlier writings point forward to the later, and the later look back to the earlier; the one writing fills out the other, until they all together form the complete and closed ring which fully and infallibly presents the divine revelation in the time of the Old Testament.
